      <p>Each semester, the Digital Humanities Lab appoints a cohort of Digital Humanities Fellows to assist with courses that have a strong digital humanities component. What that component looks like depends on the course's objectives and the Fellow's interests.</p>
      <p>During the semester, DH Fellows work closely with each other and DHLab staff to design and integrate digital humanities assignments and demonstrations into their classrooms. Prior projects include a network graph of course syllabi, an Omeka exhibition on Latin American History, and a Story Map that charts Pauli Murray's life.
