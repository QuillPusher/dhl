The DHLab welcomes graduate students to complete our Digital Humanities Certificate, starting in Fall 2023. After attending our DH Foundations workshop, certificate students will consult with DHLab staff to choose a total of six experiences (satisfied through a personalized combination of coursework, training, and/or project work) in order to demonstrate digital humanities competencies across three possible areas: job functions (project management, technical writing, etc.), DH methodologies (text mining, digitization, etc.), or programming (web development, Python for data management, etc.).
