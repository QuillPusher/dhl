### Overview

Guided Research Fellowships help faculty and graduate students develop the skills they need to pursue their own digital humanities projects. Intended to provide a collaborative research and learning experience, these awards provide recipients with the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of digital methods while  advancing a project of their own design. The fellowships may be used to support any stage of research, from dataset creation and cleaning to metadata enhancement and experimental analysis.
 
Fellowship recipients typically meet with Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) staff on a biweekly basis for research advice, hands-on tool instruction, and guidance in other areas of project development. Prior technical and programming experience is not required. Depending on their project, participants may also be interested in applying for a Rapid Prototyping Grant after completing the Guided Research process.
 
Past recipients have used their Guided Research Fellowships to:
- examine the Victorian reception of French literature on a large scale, using the methods of named entity recognition (NER) and sentiment analysis
- visualize 16th- and 17th-century indentured servants’ patterns of migration to North America and the Caribbean, using digital mapping and spatial analysis tools
 
Have a project in mind but not sure if it’s suitable for a Guided Research Fellowship? Stop by the DHLab during office hours to discuss with our team!
