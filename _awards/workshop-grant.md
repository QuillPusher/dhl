### Overview

Workshop Grants support digital humanities discussions and training opportunities on the Yale campus. Funds up to $500 might be applied toward non-Yale speaker expenses. If you have different event expenses for which you would like to apply funds, include those in your application so they may be considered. **For the 2020-2021 academic year, all events must take place virtually.**   

Past examples: Recipients have brought guest speakers to campus to offer training in a variety of digital humanities methods, from TEI to mapping.
