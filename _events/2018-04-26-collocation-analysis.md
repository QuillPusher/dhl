### Talk

Gabor Toth will discuss collocation analysis and its rich potential for exploratory text analysis. He will use the Health Reports from London (1850-1973) as case studies.

### Series Information

This is part two of a two-part series that will offer a concise introduction to word frequency and collocation analysis for the purpose of literary studies. With *The Moonstone*, *Early English Books Online* (EEBO), and Health Reports from London (1850 - 1973) as case studies, the overall goal of the two talks is to demonstrate how quantitative methods can help inform exploratory text analysis.

Attendees are welcome to attend even if they missed part one.
