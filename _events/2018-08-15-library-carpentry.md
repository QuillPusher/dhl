<h2>Library Carpentry Workshop Series: August 15 and 16</h2>

Please join us for a two-day Library Carpentry Workshop to learn how to:
- automate repetitive, boring, and error-prone tasks
- create, maintain, and analyze sustainable and reusable data
- work effectively with IT and systems colleagues
- better understand the use of software in research
and much more.

Library Carpentry introduces participants to the fundamentals of computing and provides a platform for further self-directed learning. This workshop series will introduce 'Tidy Data,' OpenRefine, UNIX Shell, and Python. We encourage participants to bring their own laptops, but lab computers will be available.

Registration is open to all Yale library staff, but space is limited. To register, please visit the <a href='http://schedule.yale.edu/event/4344752' target='_blank'>YUL Instruction Calendar</a>.

*This workshop series is sponsored by Digital Scholarship Services.*

Instructors: Catherine DeRose (Digital Humanities Lab), Joshua Dull (Digital Scholarship), and Kate Nyhan (Medical Library)
