Interested in learning Python at your own pace but aren't sure where to start? Looking to ask questions, exchange tips, or collaborate with others? Join the Python Working Group! During the weekly meetups, Yale Digital Humanities Lab team members will be on hand to answer questions and help participants work through a curated list of lessons from online tutorials.

No previous Python experience is required; all levels of programming experience are welcome.

This group meets on Fridays, unless otherwise noted below.

For the spring 2020 semester, the Python Working Group will not meet on 
- February 28 due to the <a href='https://ctdh.io/program/' target='_blank'>CT DH conference</a>. 
- April 3 due to the Beyond Boundaries symposium, which will take place in the DHLab. We hope to see you there!
- April 10 due to the DHLab being closed that day
