Interested in learning Python at your own pace but aren't sure where to start? Looking to ask questions, exchange tips, or collaborate with others? Join the Python Working Group! During the weekly meetups, Digital Scholarship team members will be on hand to answer questions and help participants work through a curated list of lessons from online tutorials.

No previous Python experience is required; all levels of programming experience are welcome.

This group meets on Fridays.
