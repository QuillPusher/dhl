Interested in learning Python at your own pace but aren't sure where to start? Looking to ask questions, exchange tips, or collaborate with others? Join the Python Working Group! During the weekly meetups, Digital Scholarship team members will be on hand to help participants work through lessons from <a href='https://www.codecademy.com/learn' target='_blank'>Codecademy</a>, a free, interactive platform for learning programming essentials. Additional online Python tutorials and reference books will also be available for use. 

No previous Python experience is required; all levels of programming experience are welcome.

This group will meet on Fridays.
