  Have your project scaffolding and user-centered design questions answered during a drop-in Project Management and UX Office Hours.
---
Are you curious about how to plan and manage a digital humanities project from start to finish? What steps are involved in moving from a research question towards project definition, user-centered design, and implementation?

These office hours are a chance to learn methods for design thinking and discuss tools and exercises that are part of the project planning life cycle. Anu Paul (Digital Scholarship
Project Manager) and Monica Ong Reed (DHLab User Experience Designer) will be available to answer questions.
