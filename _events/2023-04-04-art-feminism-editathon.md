Join us virtually or in person for the 2023 Art+Feminism Wikipedia Edit-a-thon! The <a href='https://artandfeminism.org/' target='_blank'>Art+Feminism Wikipedia Edit-a-thon campaign</a> works to increase representation of cis and trans women, non-binary people, feminism, and the arts on the Internet. In addition to teaching you how to edit, update, and add articles to Wikipedia, Yale's Edit-a-thon event will feature trivia and prize giveaways. Anyone and everyone interested in learning more about editing Wikipedia, regardless of experience, gender, or background, is welcome to attend.
