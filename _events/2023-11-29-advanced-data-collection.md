### Interactive C++

The C++ programming language is used for many numerically intensive scientific applications. A combination of performance and solid backward compatibility has led to its use for many research software codes over the past 20 years. Despite its power, C++ is often seen as difficult to learn and inconsistent with rapid application development. Exploration and prototyping is slowed down by the long edit-compile-run cycles during development.

Cling has emerged as a recognized capability that enables interactivity, dynamic interoperability and rapid prototyping capabilities to C++ developers. Cling supports the full C++ feature set including the use of templates, lambdas, and virtual inheritance. Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter, built on top of the Clang and LLVM compiler infrastructure. The interpreter enables interactive exploration and makes the C++ language more welcoming for research.
