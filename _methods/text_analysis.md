### Overview

Text mining includes a number of applications, from tracking textual reuse and the fluctuation of certain words or themes over time to stylometry and the modeling of literary forms. These texts might represent a single author's oeuvre, a periodical's full print run, or a collection of texts from across multiple centuries. Curating a dataset for text analysis often entails digitization and optical character recognition (OCR), the process of turning words from images into searchable text.

### Methods & Tools

Out-of-the-box tools that don't require any custom programming include <a href='https://voyant-tools.org/' target='_blank'>Voyant</a>, <a href='https://databasic.io/en/' target='_blank'>DataBasic</a>, <a href='http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/' target='_blank'>AntConc</a>, <a href='https://github.com/senderle/topic-modeling-tool' target='_blank'>Topic Modelig Tool</a>, JSTOR Labs's <a href='https://www.jstor.org/analyze/analyzer/progress' target='_blank'>Text Analyzer</a>, and <a href='http://www.wordle.net/create' target='_blank'>Wordle</a>.

Tools that require minimal command line usage include Stanford's <a href='https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/' target='_blank'>CoreNLP</a> (which can identify people, locations, and even sentiment in unstructured text) and Andrew McCallum's <a href='http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/' target='_blank'>MALLET</a> (which generates topic models).

Platforms that require some programming include <a href='https://github.com/Bookworm-project/BookwormDB' target='_blank'>Bookworm</a> (for tracking a word's frequency over time) and Andrew Goldstone's <a href='https://github.com/agoldst/dfrtopics/' target='_blank'>dfrtopics</a> (for visualizing topic models).

Popular packages that require more intensive levels of programming include <a href='http://www.nltk.org/' target='_blank'>the Natural Language Toolkit</a>, Stanford's <a href='https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/' target='_blank'>Stanza</a>, and the Python libraries: datasketch, NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn.
