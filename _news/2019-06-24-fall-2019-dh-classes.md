Looking for classes to take this fall? Consider one that will help you collect, analyze, or visualize humanities data! Study trends in French literature, learn a programming language, create web applications for humanities research, and more. See below for a list of classes related to the digital humanities.

*If you are teaching a course connected to DH and would like it included, please [email the Digital Humanities Lab](mailto:dhlab@yale.edu).*

### Advanced Web Application Development in the Digital Humanities
CPSC 376   
Benedict Brown

Advanced applications of computer and data science in the humanities, including web technologies, visualization, and database design. Students work in teams to develop a variety of applications proposed by faculty and staff from the Digital Humanities Lab, the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, and the Computer Science department. Meets with CPSC 376. Students may earn credit for CPSC 276 or 376; not both.

Prerequisite: CPSC 223 or equivalent, or permission of the instructor
    

### Ancients and Moderns
FREN 822  
Chrisophe Schuwey

What does it mean to be new, original, or innovative in literature? On the contrary, what does being traditional imply? What socioeconomic, ideological, and aesthetic issues lie behind those concepts and questions? This seminar addresses these questions at the time they first became central for France, when literature and arts became a market as well as a major political issue. Through literary and metaliterary works (Molière, Desjardins, La Bruyère, Scudéry, Guéret, Perrault) we reconsider our own relationship to novelty, tradition, and literary creation. In order to get hands-on with the most modern evolutions in the field, we also develop a critical edition of La Bruyère’s Les Caractères, a canonical work that looks reactionary in terms of its content and extremely modern in its printing technique. This edition is backed by a Rosenkranz grant for digital humanities in the classroom that will allow us to work with a professional designer.

Prerequisite: French reading, speaking, and writing
    

### Close Analysis of Film
FILM 320, HSAR 490  
Oksana Chefranova

The goal of this intensive seminar is to develop tools of close analysis of film as a significant art form by learning to identify elements of cinematic representation (mise-en-scène, cinematography, editing, sound, and the basic vocabulary associated with each aspect) and to demonstrate how these constituents combine to create meaning. Through developing a deeper understanding of a particular film, we transition from specific instances to broader considerations such as aesthetic and historical context or ideological critique. The course also traces the history of the close analysis method from structural semiotics and neoformalist analysis to digital humanities. We study films ranging from Hollywood and American filmmaking (Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch) and European modernism (Robert Bresson and Jean-Luc Godard) to films that use expressive codes and cultural conventions less familiar to us (Lars von Trier and Hou Hsiao-hsien). Topics include genre, the digital image, landscape, body and face, gesture and screen performance, and cinematic atmosphere.

Prerequisite: FILM 150
    
### Computational Tools for Data Science
AMTH 262, S&DS 262, CPSC 362, S&DS 562  
Roy Lederman

Introduction to the core ideas and principles that arise in modern data analysis, bridging statistics and computer science and providing students the tools to grow and adapt as methods and techniques change. Topics include principle component analysis, independent component analysis, dictionary learning, neural networks and optimization, as well as scalable computing for large datasets. Assignments will include implementation, data analysis and theory. Students require background in linear algebra, multivariable calculus, probability and programming.

Prerequisites: after or concurrently with MATH 222, 225, or 231; after or concurrently with MATH 120, 230, or ENAS 151; after or concurrently with CPSC 100, 112, or ENAS 130; after S&DS 100-108 or S&DS 230 or S&DS 241 or S&DS 242
    

### Computer Science and the Modern Intellectual Agenda
CPSC 150  
David Gelernter

Introduction to the basic ideas of computer science (computability, algorithm, virtual machine, symbol processing system), and of several ongoing relationships between computer science and other fields, particularly philosophy of mind.

No previous experience with computers necessary. Enrollment limited to 25
    

### Introduction to Computing and Programming
CPSC 100  
Benedict Brown

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and to the art of programming. Students learn how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. See [CS50's website](https://cs50.yale.edu) for additional information.

No previous programming experience required. Open to students of all levels and majors
    

### Introduction to Web Application for the Digital Humanities
CPSC 276  
Benedict Brown

Introduction to applications of computer and data science in the humanities, including web technologies, visualization, and database design. Students work in teams to develop a variety of applications proposed by faculty and staff from the Digital Humanities Lab, the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, and the Computer Science department. Meets with CPSC 376. Students may earn credit for CPSC 276 or 376; not both.

Prerequisite: CPSC 110, CPSC 112, equivalent programming experience, or permission of the instructor
    

### Literature and Philosophy from Locke to Kent
ENGL 729
Jonathan Kramnick

This is a class on epistemology, aesthetics, and literary form. We read major works in empiricism and moral philosophy alongside poetry and fiction in several genres. We ask, for example, how do poetry, fiction, and the visual arts recruit and account for perceptual experience or consider material and natural objects? What happens when the empirical psychology of consciousness or the categories of the sublime, beautiful, and picturesque take narrative or poetic form? What sort of ethical models follow from formal or generic decisions? We focus throughout on how these topics have been discussed across the history of literary studies, and we pay close attention to current debates in the field, including those prompted by new formalisms and materialisms, critical race studies, cognitive literary studies, and the digital humanities. Authors include Locke, Behn, Defoe, Pope, Addison, Hume, Burke, Sterne, Smith, Kant, and Wordsworth.
