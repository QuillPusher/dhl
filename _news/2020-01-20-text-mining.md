  Are you tracking a word's semantic change across multiple periodicals over many decades? Or maybe you're looking to perform sentiment analysis or measure changes in word frequency. Yale University Library has made it easier to identify potential datasets for your project.

Single-core performance has long been saturated, and it is critical to exploit the peak performance of heterogeneous accelerators and specialized instructions in many applications. Because compilers are difficult to extend to support diverse and rapidly evolving hardware targets, and automatic optimization is often insufficient to guarantee state-of-the-art performance, high-performance libraries are commonly still coded and optimized by hand, at great expense, in low-level C and assembly. User schedulable languages, or USLs in short, have been proposed to address the challenge by decoupling algorithms and scheduling. In this talk, I will focus on one such USL, Exo, based on the principle of exocompilation: externalizing target-specific code generation support and optimization policies to user-level code. Exo allows custom hardware instructions, specialized memories, and accelerator configuration states to be defined in user libraries. I will also talk about other projects that borrow the idea from USLs and lessons we learned from the industry adoption of Exo.

> Yuka Ikarashi is a fourth-year PhD candidate at MIT CSAIL, advised by Jonathan Ragan-Kelley. She is interested in creating compiler systems and programming languages for real-world applications. She is a co-creator of the Exo programming language and has been a developer for other compiler frameworks such as Clang/LLVM and ROOT. She previously worked at Apple, Amazon, and CERN. She received Masason Foundation Fellowship and Funai Foundation Fellowship awards.
