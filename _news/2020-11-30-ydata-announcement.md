The DHLab is excited to announce S&DS 176/576: YData: Humanities Data Mining, a new course for the Spring 2021 semester. Co-taught by DHLab Program Manager Catherine DeRose and Digital Humanities Programmer Doug Duhaime, the class offers a survey of data science methods while tackling theoretical questions at the heart of the digital humanities. It is open to all Yale undergraduates and graduate students.
 
Designed for newcomers and experienced DH students alike, YData: Humanities Data Mining explores both the theory and practice of computational humanities research. In addition to providing hands-on training in some of the most popular methods in modern data science—classification, vectorization, and visualization—the class will consider how humanistic approaches can inform the work of algorithms in research and society at large. Each week will be divided into discussion and lab sessions, pairing theoretical concepts and humanities case studies with technical work. Students also will have the opportunity to design their own data science projects using cultural heritage data.
