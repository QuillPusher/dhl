### About the Digital Tokugawa Lab
The Digital Tokugawa Lab is a digital humanities lab focusing on early modern Japanese history. For a detailed description of their work, please visit <a href='https://dtl.macmillan.yale.edu/' target='_blank'>the lab's website</a>.


### Primary Investigator
Fabian Drixler, Professor of History


### Research Assistant 1: Establishing Village Boundaries on ArcGIS
Over the summer, a collaborator of the lab ran a neural net on a corpus of about 1500 maps from the General Staff Office, surveyed between ca. 1890 and ca. 1940. These are the most highly resolved full-coverage maps of Japan, showing details at the level of individual trees, wells, and power lines. Although the neural net excerpted municipal (町村) boundaries at the time, there are some gaps in these boundaries that need to be closed  manually. Your job will be to close these gaps, then divide the municipalities into Edo-period villages using information from other maps that the lab has collected and georeferenced. The lab will teach you how to work with the specific functions in ArcGIS Pro. Other tasks are likely to arise in the course of the project, including literature searches at SML. 

*Qualifications:*
- Attention to detail.
- Interest in digital humanities, history, and/or historical geography.
- Basic knowledge of Japanese history would be a plus.
- Although it is not required for this position, ability to read or recognize Japanese or Chinese characters would be an advantage. Advanced Japanese would be an even greater advantage.

### Research Assistant 2: Understanding Relationships between Early Modern Villages
The early modern village was one of the basic units of administration in Tokugawa Japan, and often also a community of fate. The Digital Tokugawa Lab is building a database to track all 65,000 of these villages over a span of 270 years. While the village was important everywhere in Japan, precise definitions and boundaries varied by region and time. Your job will be to help research these changes using an online encyclopedic source in modern Japanese. A high level of reading comprehension is required to grasp the situation in each village and translate it into the lab's database. The lab will teach you how to work with the specific functions in relevant software (primarily Microsoft Excel and/or Access). Other tasks are likely to arise in the course of the project, including literature searches at SML.

*Qualifications:*
- Advanced Japanese is required.
- Attention to detail.
- Interest in digital humanities, history, and/or historical geography.
- Basic knowledge of Japanese history would be a plus.

### Time Commitment and Compensation
Research assistants are expected to work at least 10 hours per week on average. If a research assistant wishes to put in more time, additional hours may be assigned. The pay rate is $15 per hour. Students on a gap year are welcome to work with the Digital Tokugawa Lab full-time.

###Applying
To apply, please email a resume, a list of courses you have taken at Yale, and a brief statement of your interest in the position and your relevant background (around 150-300 words) to [Yuki Hoshino](mailto:yuki.hoshino@yale.edu).
