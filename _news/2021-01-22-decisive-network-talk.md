USC-LACMA History of Photography Seminar

RSVP to [vsri@usc.edu](mailto:vsri@usc.edu) for event link


Join Nadya Bair, Assistant Professor of Art History at Hamilton College and a former Postdoctoral Associate at the DHLab, for a discussion of her new book, *The Decisive Network: Magnum Photos and the Postwar Image Market* (University of California Press, 2020). Renowned critic and art historian Abigail Solomon-Godeau will join the conversation as a respondent. 

*The Decisive Network* draws on extensive archival research to unravel the mythologies surrounding the Magnum Photos agency. Through a systematic reexamination of Magnum's early operations, Bair reframes photojournalism as a collaborative profession, while also showing how Magnum made news images integral to visual culture in the two decades after World War II. 

The book talk will be hosted on Zoom by the USC-LACMA History of Photography Seminar. To receive a link to the event, RSVP to [vsri@usc.edu](mailto:vsri@usc.edu).
