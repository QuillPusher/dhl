### Online Lecture: Alberto Cairo, "Visualization for Communication: Design for Non-Designers"  
Data visualization expert Alberto Cairo will deliver an online lecture at the Yale School of the Environment (YSE) on Monday, Feb. 8. A journalist, designer, and professor at the University of Miami (where he is the Knight Chair in Visual Journalism), Professor Cairo will be joining YSE's "Environmental Data Visualization and Communication" class to discuss topics from his latest book, *How Charts Lie: Getting Smarter about Visual Information* (W. W. Norton, 2019). A Q&A will follow the lecture.

*How Charts Lie* examines how data visualizations like charts, diagrams, and infographics shape our understanding of the world around us. The book explores the ways that visualizations are read and misread, constructed and deconstructed -- and offers readers the tools they need to be knowledgeable consumers of visual information.
