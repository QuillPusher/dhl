Apply for a DH Training Scholarship in 2021! The Yale Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) is excited to announce a limited number of $500 scholarships for Yale students and library staff participating in digital humanities workshops. Applications to attend any program will be considered, provided that it is digital humanities intensive and at least three days long. 

Past recipients have used these scholarships to attend workshops such as the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI), Humanities Intensive Learning and Teaching (HILT), Digital Humanities @ Oxford (DHOxSS), DH @ Guelph, the Trier Digital Humanities Autumn School, and the Summer School in Chinese Digital Humanities. Those seeking training opportunities this summer may also be interested in the California Rare Book School (CalRBS), Dream Lab, and the European Summer University in Digital Humanities; further information about these three programs can be found below.

All Yale students and library staff are welcome to apply! Scholarship applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until funds are exhausted. To learn more, or to submit an application, please visit the DHLab’s <a href='https://dhlab.yale.edu/awards/dh-training-scholarship.html' target='_blank'>DH Training Scholarships page.</a>

### Culture & Technology: European Summer University in Digital Humanities

Tentatively planning to meet in person  

Co-organized by the Forum für Digital Humanities Leipzig (FDHL) at the University of Leipzig, the European Summer University in Digital Humanities offers 11-day-long workshops on a variety of technical and theoretical topics. This year’s schedule covers a wide array of digital humanities subject matter, including optical character recognition (OCR), digital annotation, archival practices, and digital mapping.
