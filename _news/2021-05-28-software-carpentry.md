Learn new computing and software skills this summer through a Software Carpentry workshop series! Taught by staff members and librarians from the Yale Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) and the Marx Science & Social Science Library, these four workshops will provide training in spreadsheet work, OpenRefine, and Python. Sessions will be held online the mornings of June 10, 11, 17, and 18.

Software Carpentry aims to help researchers work more efficiently and effectively by teaching them the basics of research computing. The hands-on, collaborative workshop series will cover key concepts and tools for data management, analysis, and programming, and will encourage participants to apply these skills to their own research problems. No prior knowledge of spreadsheets, OpenRefine, or Python is required.

All Yale students, faculty, and staff are invited to register! Details about the workshop series can be found below. To learn more, or to sign up, please email the DHLab at [dhlab@yale.edu](mailto:dhlab@yale.edu).
