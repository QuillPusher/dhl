### Overview

*Pauli Murray: A Digiography*, is a virtual repository of Pauli Murray materials (documents, writings, sermons, images, audio speeches and interviews) that chronicles myriad dimensions of Pauli Murray’s personal, professional, and activist lives. In using the extant corpus of secondary materials that scholars and print humanists have created, combined with Murray-related primary sources as data, the project intends to glean patterns, trajectories, and discrepancies between the two that are otherwise unseen or too overwhelming for traditional source analyses to capture. The Pauli Murray Digiography explores the distance between primary source and secondary source, however small or large, thus providing an opportunity for herstorians to revise existing narratives and create new projects from the strength of the virtual repository. 

The implications of this project are important for Digital Humanities, historical studies, and the African American Studies. For DH, this project presents a new form of thinking historically through the use of DH tools. It privileges non-linear, multi-site, story-telling as process, rather than as final product. It also joins the corpus of DH projects that focus on African Americans and activism. For History, this project will force historians to reconsider their methodologies, particularly in regard to the archive, biography, and movement history. Drawing on the insights of African American Studies, particularly the discipline’s critique of Western epistemologies, this project endeavors to chart a methodology for assembling life stories that reveals factors, events, and relationships overlooked in the process of writing herstory.
