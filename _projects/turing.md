I am Alan Turing is an opera composed by Professor Matthew Suttor that seeks to shine new light on the space of contact between human and machine. How do we interact with technology and to what end? How does technology interact with us? Using AI software designed for text generation, the opera pursues these questions and others to help us rethink our relationship with technology in the twenty-first century.

But who was Alan Turing? Turing was an outstanding mathamatician and cryptogropher who cracked the German enigma code during World War II. Hearlded by Professor Suttor as the "father of modern computing," Turing’s life would come to a tragic end. At age 41, Turing would take his own life after being sentenced to receive estrogen hormone treatment as a corrective punishment for being gay.

Can machines think? Turing was fascinated by this question, and it’s a question the Turing team have picked up and are looking to explore in their own way using OpenAI’s natural language processing model, the GPT-2. The GPT-2  is an algorithm that can express meaningful sentences based on material it’s been fed. With the help of Yale Digital Humanitst, Doug Duhaime and Blended Reality’s Farid Abdul, the Turing team was able to interact with the GTP-2 directly and pose questions to it after it had been trained on Turing’s writings as well as on material he had read in his lifetime. Can a machine write a libretto? The short answer is yes. What would that libretto look like? The Turing team is well on their way to answering this question.

Information on the project’s beginnings as well as audio from the early stages of the project’s development can be found in the team's [performance at Level Up](https://www.levelup.designers.ca/i-am-alan-turing).
