### Digital Humanities Lab

A unit of Yale University Library, the Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) offers individual and group consultations for Yale students, faculty, and staff working on digital humanities projects at any stage of development. DHLab staff can address questions related to best practices for corpus creation, data visualization and analysis, digital tools, and more. In addition to scheduled meetings, the DHLab also offers weekly drop-in [Office Hours](http://dhlab.yale.edu/resources/office-hours.html) (Monday through Thursday) as another opportunity to discuss projects and the digital humanities more generally. <br/><a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe4Lyo8EEdoiTLosfnmOUNEsZZToCD_n7dZ10ypCerw4diJGA/viewform?usp=sf_link' class='color-button' target='_blank'>Make an Appointment</a>

### Data, GIS, and Statistical Support Services at Marx Library

Librarians and statistical consultants at <a href='https://marx.library.yale.edu/data-gis-and-statistical-support-services-marx-library' target='_blank'>Marx Library</a> can provide you with services to help you find, use, and manage your research data. If you are looking for science or social science data, we can help you find publicly available sources or, in some cases, purchase data if it is not freely available. Once you have the data you need, we can help you find the resources at Yale that will allow you to manipulate and analyze your data.
