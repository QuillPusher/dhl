### Data Mining
Whenever possible, the Yale University Library works with database vendors to include text and data mining (TDM) rights in license agreements. This means that for some databases (generally those with out-of-copyright materials), Yale researchers can access the raw text for the purposes of mining. Vendors that currently permit text and data mining on specific collections include: Adam Matthew, Gale, ProQuest, and others. For additional information on these agreements and which collections are available for mining, please visit the <a href='https://guides.library.yale.edu/tdm' target='_blank'>Text and Data Mining LibGuide</a>.

What about material that hasn't been digitized yet? The Digital Humanities Lab can provide tools for the creation of digital corpora for text and data mining purposes (rather than for preservation or personal archives) to researchers with current DHLab awards. For longer duration or all-purpose scanning, researchers may use the machines in the Nave of Sterling Memorial Library or in the lower level of Bass Library.
