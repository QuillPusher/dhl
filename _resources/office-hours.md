Looking to start a digital project but don't know where to begin? Curious about best practices in data visualization or programming? <!--Stop by the Digital Humanities Lab during open Office Hours to chat with our team.--> Talk with our team during Office Hours. We offer consultations on all stages of a digital humanities project, from finding and curating datasets to visualizing, analyzing, and sharing your findings.
 
Office Hours provide a weekly opportunity to exchange ideas, discuss methods, and form connections with colleagues from different programs and departments.
