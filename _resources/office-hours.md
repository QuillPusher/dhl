Looking to start a digital project but don't know where to begin? Curious about best practices in data visualization or programming? Talk with our team during Office Hours. We offer consultations on all stages of a digital humanities project, from finding and curating datasets to visualizing, analyzing, and sharing your work.
 
Office Hours provide a weekly opportunity to exchange ideas, discuss methods, and form connections with colleagues from different programs and departments.
 
Whether you are new to the field and would like to learn more, have an existing project and seek a communal workspace, or are somewhere in between, we invite you to reach out!
