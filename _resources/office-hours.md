Looking to start a digital project but don't know where to begin? Need recommendations on tools, techniques, and best practices? Stop by the Digital Humanities Lab during open Office Hours or schedule an individual consultation with one of our staff members.  
 
Office Hours provide a weekly opportunity to exchange ideas, discuss methods, and form connections with colleagues from different programs and departments.
 
Whether you are new to the field and would like to learn more, have an existing project and seek a communal workspace, or are somewhere in between, we invite you to reach out!
