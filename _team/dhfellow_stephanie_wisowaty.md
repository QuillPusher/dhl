Stephanie Wisowaty studies medieval European art and visual culture. Her research focuses on themes of vision and visuality in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Italian art such as the connection between sight and memory, the nature of miraculous images and the relationship between corporeal and spiritual sight. She has previously worked as a museum educator and curator at the Yale University Art Gallery.

As a Digital Humanities Fellow for Professor Jacqueline Jung’s course “Art and Architecture of the Sacred: A Global Perspective," Stephanie will work alongside her cohort to help students explore visual and geographic themes with digital tools.
