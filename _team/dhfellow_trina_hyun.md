Trina Hyun is Ph.D. Candidate in English studying the literature and religious culture of early modern England, as well as its surprising connections to twentieth-century media theory. Her dissertation focuses on early modern English devotional poetry and prose. The project argues for the inclusion of early modern religion and metaphysics in the longer, traditionally secular history of media and communication.

As a Digital Humanities Fellow for "Reading and Writing the Modern Essay," Trina will work with students to reimagine the media through which they present their essays. This will include discussions on the theoretical foundations of and embodied action required by digital media.
