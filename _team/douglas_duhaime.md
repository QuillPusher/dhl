Douglas Duhaime is a Digital Humanities Developer for the DHLab. He comes to the lab from ProQuest, where he developed Digital Humanities software products as the Text and Data Mining Product Manager, and the University of Notre Dame, where he completed a dissertation on algorithmic approaches to early modern authorship. He will hold a spring 2021 appointment as a Lecturer in Yale's Department of Statistics and Data Science, for which he will co-teach YData's first credit-bearing course on Humanities Data Mining.

Before joining the lab, Douglas partnered with the HathiTrust Research Center on an HTRC Advanced Collaborative Research Grant, and participated in the NEH-sponsored "Early Modern Digital Agendas", a research summit on computational approaches to early modern English history held at the Folger Library.
