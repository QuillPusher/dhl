      <p>The 2015 founding of the Yale University Library Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLab) signifies the University's continued commitment to cutting-edge research and teaching in the humanities. Offering space, community, and resources within the Library for Yale researchers who are working with digital methods to pursue humanistic inquiries, the DHLab functions as a hub on campus for digital humanities research and teaching. Staff are available to consult at any stage in a project, from conceptualization through implementation.</p>
      <p>Yale's roots in digital humanities undertakings date back (at least) to Father Roberto Busa's visit to our campus in 1956 and the Computers for the Humanities conference that was sponsored by Yale on a grant from IBM in 1965. Stop by the lab to read through the conference proceedings and see what has and hasn't changed in discussions of the field!</p>
      <p>Generously funded by the Goizueta Foundation, the DHLab is committed to advancing science, technology, engineering, the arts, and mathematics (STEAM) teaching and research at Yale. In addition to facilitating cross-disciplinary collaborations on campus, the DHLab also promotes faculty and student initiatives that reach beyond the University to engage wider publics.</p>
      <p>The DHLab is a part of <a href='http://web.library.yale.edu/sd/dept/digital-scholarship-services' target='_blank'>Digital Scholarship Services</a> within Yale University Library, a group which also includes the <a href='http://statlab.stat.yale.edu/' target='_blank'>StatLab</a> and support for Research Data.</p>
