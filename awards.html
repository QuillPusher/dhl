    <p>Each semester, the Digital Humanities Lab appoints a cohort of Digital Humanities Fellows to assist with courses that have a strong digital humanities component. These positions provide semester-long support for graduate students to engage with digital humanities methods and theories in a classroom setting.</p>
    <p>DHLab staff work with Fellows to design digital humanities assignments, arrange access to electronic content, and provide specialized technical training. Visit the <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/about/teaching_fellows.html' target='_blank'>DH Fellows page</a> to learn about our current recipients and their courses.</p>

    <p>Guided Research Fellowships help Yale graduate students develop the skills they need to pursue their own digital humanities projects. Intended to provide a collaborative research and learning experience, these awards offer recipients the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of digital methods while advancing a project of their own design.</p>
    <p>Fellowship recipients typically meet with DHLab staff on a bi-weekly basis for research advice, hands-on tool instruction, and guidance in other areas of project development. The fellowships may be used to support any stage of research, from dataset creation to analysis.</p>
